# Localization_Algorithm
Code for BLE-based Localization Algorithm

This code has the three step for localization.
The first is a step that obtains initial target positions based on LS approach.
The second is a step that updates target position based on Bayesian rule.
The last is a step that compensates for target positon using a Kalman filter.

This code is operated repeatedly, following the above steps.
